// as eaarly as possible the dotenv should be configured so that the environment variables can be used
//by any file in the project that has its requirements.

//if we use import we need to configure the dotenv file here
//here we do the connection in index.js in db folder and call it here, so that the connection is made
//but in approach 1 we do everything in a place and do not call it from anywhere

//why use dotenv here??
//because we need to use the environment variables in connectDB and we need to configure the dotenv file
//so that the environment variables can be used by the connectDB file
//if we do not use dotenv here, we need to configure the dotenv file in the connectDB file
//and we need to configure the dotenv file in every file that uses the environment variables
//so to avoid this we use dotenv here so that the environment variables can be used by any file in the project
